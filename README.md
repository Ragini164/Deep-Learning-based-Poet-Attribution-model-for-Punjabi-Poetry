# Deep Learning-Based Poet Attribution Model for Punjabi Poetry

## About
As poetry gains visibility online, so do instances of plagiarism and misattribution, where poems are reshared without proper credit to the original authors. To help address this, our project focused on developing a deep learning model for author attribution in Punjabi poetry across Shahmukhi, Gurmukhi, and Roman scripts. While existing research primarily covered Gurmukhi, we aimed to make our model more inclusive and accessible by working with all three scripts. Using a dataset of 830 poems from 11 poets, collected through web scraping and manual translation, we applied Multilingual DistilBERT with bidirectional LSTM and GRU models. The model achieved test accuracies of 91.57% (Roman), 90.36% (Gurmukhi), and 87.95% (Shahmukhi). This work was awarded Best Paper at ICETST 2024 and is available on IEEE Xplore.
